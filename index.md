# Saucedacity

A free, open source audio editor based on Audacity. Saucedacity has the same features as Audacity in addition to using the same project format. However, we've removed the autoupdater and telemetry that originally came with Audacity. We're more than just that, though.

# Contributing
Want to contribute? Feel free to! No knowledge of coding required, as we still have a couple of tasks to be done that _don't_ involve coding. For more info, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/saucedacity/saucedacity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you want to contribute code, however, you need to know C++ as Saucedacity is written in C++.

Regardless, you can find issues in our issue tracker, found [here](https://github.com/saucedacity/saucedacity/issues), that always need fixing.
