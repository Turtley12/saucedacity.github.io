# Saucedacity

A free, open source audio editor based on Audacity. Saucedacity has the same features as Audacity in addition to using the same project format. However, we've removed the autoupdater and telemetry that originally came with Audacity. We're more than just that, though.

# Features

* Recording from any real, or virtual audio device that is available to the host system.
* Export / Import a wide range of audio formats, extendible with FFmpeg.
* High quality using 32-bit float audio processing.
* Plug-ins Support for multiple audio plug-in formats, including VST, LV2, AU.
* Macros for chaining commands and batch processing.
* Scripting in Python, Perl, or any language that supports named pipes.
* Nyquist Very powerful built-in scripting language that may also be used to create plug-ins.
* Editing multi-track editing with sample accuracy and arbitrary sample rates.
* Accessibility for VI users.
* Analysis and visualization tools to analyze audio, or other signal data.

# Contributing
Want to contribute? Feel free to! No knowledge of coding required, as we still have a couple of tasks to be done that _don't_ involve coding. For more info, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/saucedacity/saucedacity/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md). If you want to contribute code, however, you need to know C++ as Saucedacity is written in C++.

Regardless, you can find issues in our issue tracker, found [here](https://github.com/saucedacity/saucedacity/issues), that always need fixing.
